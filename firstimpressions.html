Short guidance: “How to figure out that you are abroad?”.

1. Look at your phone. Usual carrier’s name probably has already been replaced by scribbled scribbles.

2. Turn on TV. 3.Look out of the window.

Still can’t believe, where are you? I understand. When in the first morning I opened my eyes, I could not wrap my head around why everything looks so different.

Memories of yesterday trip, like tiny pieces of big puzzle, pop up in random order, making it difficult to look at picture as whole. And the more you think about it, the more you believe in new reality. And reality is that phone battery is totally dead, and all outlets have totally different shape. But all of this does not matter, because it is already 5:25 AM, which is exactly 5 minutes before start of working day. That information was very particular in my job offer.

It took me couple minutes to get on the first floor of the hotel, where I had to live for the next few months. Sun played with light, dropping rays and making shadows, trough glass front doors of the hotel on the walls inside. I felt like it almost asked me come outside.

Although all customs points have already been passed, at that very moment, I thought that border is located on the level of the door. It looked different now. It was not border – passport control. It was border of extending of my perception, conscious step outside. Like in movies about wizards, they open a door, and turn out to be in totally different place. That describes my excitement most accurately.

The weather was just wonderful! I took a deep breath and squinted because beam of light flashed from the window of passing by car. When I looked on my watch, it was exactly 5:30 AM which meant that I had to go back.

There was a little hallway right after entrance to the hotel. Woman at front desk was checking out early birds. Manager's office was on the left side, and little café on the right. Just one woman was preparing breakfast area for visitors. She had company shirt on, so I decided to come and ask her if she knows when can I start working today. She started smiling and then laughing of me. Turns out she was the only person other than overnight front desk specialist, who comes here so early. Manager, housekeepers, and rest of stuff, does not show up until 9 o’clock.

I had wonderful opportunity to have a walk around my new neighborhood. This Burger King, fast food restaurant, located right next to the hotel. 
</p>

<p class = "p2">I was starving to death, so I went there for breakfast.

Clearly remember what I ordered that morning. It was an order of 10 pieces of chicken nuggets for $1.39. If I were to order 20, would have paid $4.99. Still can’t understand why they have such a weird price. Usually it is at best restaurant interests to sell you more, advertising lower prices for bigger amount of product.

McDonalds was conveniently located 50 meters from the hotel. It didn’t offer any service by that time, because it was in the process of reconstruction. If you want to go a little bit further, you can come across family restaurant "Applebee's". By the end of the summer I received my first restaurant experience as host in the facility. (I didn’t have daytime shot of the place).

It’s very difficult to describe this small town. Milford is located 50 miles from Boston, which is about one hour drive. And even though I didn’t live there quite long, I knew from beginning, that I want to get to Boston as soon as possible. When I think about America as foreigner, I imagine it from movies. Pictures, sounds, everything comes from them. Movies are usually filmed in big cities: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago. Unfortunately, Milfrod was nowhere near that list in my head by that time. The hotel was located two minutes from cemetery. And it seemed like light orange walls of the hotel were the brightest spot among empty landscape. The most frequent visitors were Spanish speaking truck drivers, and people who would stay overnight because of the concert nearby.

There was a plaza right across the road. No. It’s not a name of another hotel. This is the way they call stores located in the same place and usually, there is huge parking area as well. Number of available spots usually exceeds occupied. I think situation in other small towns across the country is similar. The best example of plazas in post-soviet countries is markets. With only difference that everything is totally different J

To get to the capital of New England, I had to board train at station Forge Park 495. It takes 2h 20 minutes walking, 40 minutes bicycling, and 10 minutes driving to get there. But bus service was only available with frequency one time a day. So, if all roads lead to Rome, in Milford, all roads lead to Highway 495, which eventually leads to Boston.
</p>
<p class = "p2">Despite all frustration, there was something pleasant in this town. Wherever I would be coming from, I would always have this feeling like I am going home. Of course, not in regular definition of this word. But home, like easily understandable and simple place. Somewhere you are used to be. Every trip to Boston was wonderful. In Milford, though, I could sum something up and realize what I want.

As I already noticed earlier, there was a cemetery not far from the hotel. But it looked differently from what you would see in Ukraine. You aren’t feeling sad when passing by. Everything looks very neat and I would even say poetic. I don’t know whether it is strange or not, but I am acquainted at least with two people, who go there to stay alone with own thoughts. If for regular human being life is defined by start and end, time goes slower there, and almost stops. That’s apparently the reason, why they do it. Of course, not every day. Sometimes.

There is a nice bike path in Milford. It’s called “Upper Charles trail”. Taking into the account high quality asphalt surface, I decided that it was designed for bike rides. But most people use it for running. Once I made my way up to this charming place. It’s somewhere between Milford and Franklin. Looks like a fairytale, right? (picture on the left). In some sense, I got lucky, because I lived there over the summer. Had I arrived in winter, I would not be able to find as many positive moments as I have found from June to August. People who live here all the time, told me about their furious snowfalls.

Oh! I almost forgot to share one very interesting fact. Few day later, I met a woman, who has lived in the town entire life and never!!! I repeat never has been to Boston. Honestly, I am feeling very sad because of that. I can’t realize how is it possible to give up on such a wonderful opportunity to see beautiful city, which is just one hour away. Some people fly over half the planet, to another part of the world, just to see something new. To discover unknown.
</p>
<p class = "p2">
Let’s talk a little bit more about that trail. I had very nice feeling being there. Just you and nature. In general, if we were to subtract the inherent properties of what we think American Architecture is, it is easy to forget that you are in another country. When there is nothing but nature around, it is difficult to find any differences with what you are used to see at home. Grass as grass, ground as ground... And this is probably why our planet so unique. Wherever you go, you will find similarity in something, and that something will be letting you know that you are home. Because eventually, all the borders – is just some sort of misunderstanding. In ideal world, we should all be able to share planet equally. Go places. Anywhere. Anytime. Is not it so?

Big trees hide houses. Houses themselves are not very big here. But they all look attractive. It’s easy to imagine coming back from work, or having barbecue on the weekend with family and friends.
Church, school, police station – everything looks accordingly to overall atmosphere. The more you live here, the more you feel cozy and comfortable. I think even in such a tiny town as Milford, it is possible to take nice shots, or get inspired on making something wonderful. Write a book for example.
I have very high requirements to myself and consider to be absolute perfectionist. High demands in everything and everyone around, didn’t make it possible for me to stay there. I prefer atmosphere of competition rather than comfort. Atmosphere, where you can grow personally, not just spiritually. But I think that sometime, it is possible, that I will change my mind.
