<p class = "p1">Good evening, my dear reader! You are in a place where I share my impressions about life in the United States. I used to live in a different country, and study cinema-photography art, so a lot of pictures which I have taken since my first day will be published here as well.

Over this year of new life I have experienced many interesting events, as well as unpleasant incidents. Following stereotypes about behavior of the people I am most likely introvert. So It's probably much harder for me to adapt to the new society, to take four steps, where someone will be fine with two. But again, to be successful and happy, we should not compare ourselves to someone else.
 </p>
 <p class = "p2">
 People look for excuses all the time. The biggest enemy of yours is yourself. Dreams come true! You just have to do something about it.

I do not expect this blog to impress anyone, nor do I think it is any different from many other stories you might have read. But here are three reasons why I am paying $11.99/ month for this website:
<ul class ="ddd">
<li class="lll">First of all, this is my attempt to express my thoughts and into some sort of a product. Make it real.</li>
<li class="lll">I just have to find another hobby.</li>
<li class="lll">I really enjoy typing lol</li>
<br>
You all have a good day there, and I will try too! :)
